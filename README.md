# AOP Log Project

## Overview
The **AOP Log Project** is a Spring-based application that utilizes Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to provide logging, performance monitoring, and data validation capabilities. The project is designed to handle complex business logic while improving application performance and managing ambiguous user data. It offers a modular, flexible structure for integrating AOP features like **Around Advice**, **After Advice**, and **Failsafe Validation**.

## Features

### 1. **Logging and Performance Monitoring**
   - **AOP Log Before**: Logs function calls before they are executed.
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Uses **Around Advice** to measure the execution time of methods for performance monitoring.
   - **After Advice**: Executes logging and monitoring tasks after method execution.
   
### 2. **Data Validation**
   - **Failsafe Validation**: Validates user input data using **Around Advice**, ensuring that ambiguous or incorrect data is flagged before further processing.
   
### 3. **Custom AOP Advices**
   - **Around Advice**: Custom handling of method calls before and after execution, particularly useful for logging and performance tracking.
   - **After Advice**: Implements additional behavior after method execution.

### 4. **Spring Project Setup**
   - Basic Spring setup with AOP configuration for seamless integration of aspects and advices.
